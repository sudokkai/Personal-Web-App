        <p>
        I am a Grade 12 Student currently enrolled in 
        Western Technical Commercial School's Robotics Program. 
        When I initially came to this school, my goal was to pursue 
        engineering, however, I have since decided that I enjoy 
        having a life too much! This is why my pursuit in tech 
        is now purely for self-enjoyment and fun.</p>
