            <b>GUI - Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder:</b><br>
            
            - Our GUI is a Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder, the program pulls from the MagicGatherer API in order to let a user search for 
            Magic cards by name and add them to a deck. <br>- The program was created by Henry Marrone and Kai Glasiek, with an honourable mention to Tai Poole.
            <br> - Implementing the API was a considerable challenge. However, utilising it was made much easier by an existing SDK.
            <br> - We're hoping to implement ways to save a deck and see additional deck data.<br>
            <br>

            <b>Interactive App - Foundry:</b>
            <br>
    
            - Foundry is a Magic the Gathering Deckbuilder, the program builds off the capabilities of our GUI but with added features. Foundry
            has all the capabilities of the GUI, however it saves user deck data to a JSON file so decks aren't lost after use of the program. Additionally, 
            we hope to have Foundry find and display relevant data about the user's deck.
            <br>- The program is in development by Henry Marrone and Kai Glasiek.
            <br> - The program currently has fully working UI and JSON integration.
            <br> - Once the current stretch goals are met, we're hoping to have the program write to an Excel Spreadsheet for easy data compilation and analysis.<br>
