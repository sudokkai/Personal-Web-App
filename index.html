        <p>I am a Grade 12 Student currently enrolled in 
            Western Technical Commercial School's Robotics Program. 
            When I initially came to this school, my goal was to pursue 
            engineering, however, I have since decided that I enjoy 
            having a life too much! This is why my pursuit in tech 
            is now purely for self-enjoyment and fun.</p>

                <p>This is a project I did for my job working at Chrystia Freelands constituency office. The program automatically sorts
                    emails based on postal code and other sorting methods. Data sheets are then made and put into excel.
